# Technologies Used
This is my first serious full stack project using the **MongoDB**, **React**, **Express** and **NodeJS** (*MERN*) Stack. Featuring a custom authentication system using **JSON Web Tokens** for session management, and Google OAuth for SSO. 

## Features

 - *Custom* **theme** and **design**, layout preplanned in Inkscape, a vector based graphics editor.
 - *Custom* CSS implemented using **TailwindCSS**, a utility based CSS framework.
 - *Fully* **responsive** design for a better User Experience.
 - *State management* involved React's **useReducer** hook and their **Context** **API**.
 - *Live chat feature* uses **WebSockets**, implemented by the NodeJS package socket.io, allowing for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This allows for all clients to receive socket messages at the same time and update thier state accordingly.
 - **Mongoose**, a MongoDB wrapper, was used as a *Object Relational Wrapper* (ORM) to simplify the process of reading and writing to the database.
